## Project Description
The objective was to make a MSP430 into a toy and have fun with it. To
make it a toy, I chose popular songs that most people are familiar with so
they could play the song. The purpose was, for those who use the toy, to play
the beats according to the rythm of the songs that I chose. The trick is that
the people using it have to guess what two songs are in the MSP430! The LED
lights also change colors from red to green when the buttons are pressed.
